# Repository Governance

## Standard Baseline

- Default branch: `main`.
- Branch policy: staged `protect-main` ruleset where GitHub plan support exists.
- Required evidence: PR description, test/verification notes, and release impact.
- Marketplace policy: use GitHub-native features and low-permission Actions first.

## Staged Protection Model

1. Prepare README, contribution, security, issue, PR, and CI files.
2. Run CI on pull requests until status check names are stable.
3. Enable `protect-main` ruleset or branch protection only after required checks are reliable.
4. Keep private repositories documented even when plan limits prevent rulesets.

## Marketplace Resource Policy

Recommended baseline:

- GitHub Actions for project-local checks.
- Dependabot for GitHub Actions and ecosystem updates.
- GitHub CodeQL / security features where the language and plan support it.
- Markdown and artifact hygiene checks implemented as low-permission Actions.

Avoid by default:

- Paid SaaS apps unless there is a clear recurring review burden.
- Apps requiring broad repository write access without a narrow purpose.
- Duplicate review bots on small repositories.
